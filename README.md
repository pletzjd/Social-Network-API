# UTOR-VIRT-FSF-FT-05-2022-U-LOLC

## Description

The goal of the project was to use mongoDB to create an api for a Social-Network site that could handle creating, reading updating and deleting users, post (thoughts) from the user and comments on those post (reactions) from other users.

## Live Deployment link

The app does not have a live deployemnt but can be pulled from my github and installed
https://github.com/pletzjd/Social-Network-API

## Installation
A copy of the code can be obtained by doing a pull request from the github repository above. Once a copy is on your machine open the command line interface in the Social networt api. type in 'npm install' to install all the required packages. Then type npm start to start the program. Information can be added to the database using a tool such as insomnia to make the various request the application allows.


## Usage

Once the program has been successfully installed you can run the program by typing 'npm start' into the command line opened in the root folder of the program. From here you can use the varous api routes to alter the database
